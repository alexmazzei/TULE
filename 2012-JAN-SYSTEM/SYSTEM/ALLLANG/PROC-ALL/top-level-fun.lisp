; ******** FUNCTIONS FOR SERVERS ******************************************
; *************************************************************************
; *** The organization is based on the input and output of sentences (at 
;     different level of analysis) as strings of set of sentences.
; *** There are two main "public" functions for the analysis, the first one
;     for syntax, the second one for semantics. They are based on some
;     sub-functions, that are also usable from outside, since they exchange
;     data as strings. The overall schema is as follows:
;
;     tule-morpho-and-parse      (parsing from raw input text)
;       |------> tule-tokenizer  (splits the input texts in words and sentences)
;       |------> tule-analyser   (morphological analysis and access to dictionary)
;       |------> tule-postagger  (part of speech tagging)
;       |------> tule-parser     (parsing into avm format)
;
;     tule-semantic-interpreter  (from avm trees to fol formulae)
;       |------> tule-annotate   (adds to the avm trees pointers to ontology)
;       |------> tule-build-ontorepr (builds graphs based on the ontology)
;       |------> tule-build-fol  (builds the final fol formulae)
;
; *** Note that nothing is read or written on files, though the two main functions
;     also act as dispatchers, since they accept also other input formats. This
;     does not hold for the sub-functions

; *** The next is just for debugging purposes *********************

; *************************************************************************
; *** the next is the main function for carrying out morphological analysis,
;     pos tagging and parsing.
; *** The input can be:
;     - empty (nil), in which case a dialogue is started with the user
;       to get the name of a file or a set of files that have to be processed
;       (this is done inside ana-and-tag-and-parse)
;       or a string that includes one or more sentences.
; *** The output is either written on files (if the input is from file) or a
;     string including the avm representation of the parse trees of the input 
;     sentence. The string includes a list each of whose elements is an avm tree.
